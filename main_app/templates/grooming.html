   <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; text-indent: 50px;">
    Tangles and mats are a big source of anxiety for pet owners, especially those who have long-haired pets. Tangles and mats can irritate your pet's skin, so combing his or her coat on a daily basis is the best way to avoid them.

    <br>A simple brush can be frightening to certain animals. Rebecca Lohnes, the Behavior & Training Manager at Lollypop Farm, suggests starting carefully, especially if your pet is nervous. "If your pet is afraid of brushes, using a high-value food like peanut butter or cream cheese is a fantastic way to expose them to one," Rebecca explained. "You may begin by providing the goodie when the brush is in close proximity to them. Work up to using the brush with them, starting with brief sessions and gradually increasing the time until they are calm and comfortable."

   <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; text-indent: 50px;">
    While your personal shampoo may smell nicer than your dog's, these products frequently include chemicals that might irritate your pet's skin or cause harm to their coat. Human shampoo lacks the necessary pH balance for your dog's fur, and using it might result in an unexpected trip to the veterinarian.

   <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; text-indent: 50px;">
    Make a strategy for how to approach bathtime in a stress-free manner when a bath is required due to scents or a mud hole your dog discovered outside. Bathing your pet with a partner may be beneficial since one person can focus on your pet's safety and praising excellent behavior while the other does the washing, massaging, and rinsing.

   <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; text-indent: 50px;">
    Your dog's nails are definitely becoming a little long if you don't take him to the groomer on a regular basis. While some dogs are OK with their owners touching their paws and trimming their nails, others may be wary. Another way to keep your nails in good shape is to sand them on a baking sheet. Simply place the sandpaper on top of the sheet, and when your pet places their paw on it, give them with a treat.

   <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; text-indent: 50px;">
    Your veterinarian is always your best resource, now more than ever, if your pet has a health-related concern. If you detect any problems with your pet's health or behavior, the first place you should go is to your local veterinarian, who can help you and determine whether your pet need emergency medical assistance.

   <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; ">
    Here are some grooming tools you could require:
    <br>
    <br> •Shampoo that is suited for your pet's age and species (kittens and puppies need gentle shampoo; very young animals need products free of harsh pesticides; and ferrets should have ferret shampoo)
    <br>•To get a great lather, use a large cup or a small bucket filled with water.
    <br>•Cotton swabs
    <br>•Cleaner for the ears
    <br>•Controlling parasites products (ask your veterinarian about what is needed in your area for fleas, ticks and mites)
    <br>•Comb made of metal
    <br>•Using a brush (there are many styles to choose from: pin, rake, slicker, mitt or curry)
    <br>•Nail trimmers (find out what size works best for your pet's nails)
    <br>•File with a nail (some animals will actually sleep while their people file each toenail)
    <br>•Powder for styptic (to use if you accidentally cut a nail too short)
    <br>•An ophthalmic ointment is a type of ointment that is used to (used in the eyes to protect them from shampoo and debris)
    <br>•Conditioner or detangler (great for combing through long hair before a final rinse)
    <br>•Attachment for your shower spray (very helpful for rinsing your pet)
    <br>•A blow dryer (because some animals can chill easily, but be careful not to overheat the pet)
    <br>•Toothbrush and toothpaste for animals
    <br>•Security scissors for hair trimming
    <br>•Snapper (if you want to learn to style your pet)

    <br><br>
    in addition:

    <br>

    <br>•Use ceramic blades when trimming many animals at the same time. With repeated usage, they remain cold and sharp. As you clip, it's a good practice to touch the clipper blade to the back of your wrist. It's fine to keep using it if it's cool enough to touch your wrist. Spray with Kool Lube and recheck on your wrist if it's too hot.

    <br>•A grooming table is a terrific method to keep your dog or cat in position while also preventing back strain. For footing, they have a rubber mat surface.

    <br>•If you don't have a grooming table, use a rubber mat on the floor to aid with footing. This will motivate you to stand instead of lying down.

Continue reading to learn how to maintain your dog's fur, skin, nails, teeth, ears, and paws clean and healthy.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 align="center" style="margin-top:2%;"><strong>BATHING YOUR DOG</strong></h2>

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        1. Brush your pet well to remove any dead hair and mats, and then place him or her in a tub or sink filled with three to four inches of lukewarm water.
<br><br>2. Then fully soak your pet with a spray hose, a large plastic pitcher, or an unbreakable cup.
<br><br>3. Avoid spraying or pouring water directly into his ears, eyes, or nose.
<br><br>4. Rinse and repeat as needed after gently massaging in shampoo from head to tail.
<br><br>5. Give your pet a nice massage with a big towel to completely dry him or her. And there you have it: a clean pet!
    </p>

    <br>

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Shar Peis and Pugs, for example, may require extra care because to their loose face skin and wrinkles. Clean the folds with moist cloth to avoid irritation and infection from dirt and germs. Always make sure the regions between the folds are completely dry.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%;"><strong>BATHING A PUPPY</strong></h4>

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Some puppies believe that bath time is the best time to be silly! Young pups, in particular, squirm and bounce all over the place and are prone to nipping during bath time. Put a floating toy in the tub with her if this sounds like your pet so she may focus on that instead of mouthing you.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%;"><strong>CHOOSING A SHAMPOO</strong></h4>

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">It's recommended to use a shampoo made specifically for dogs. Although human shampoos are not dangerous to pets, some may include perfumes or other ingredients that irritate your pet's skin. Because some components may be dangerous when applied to different sorts of pets, choose a product that is particularly made for your species of animal. It's always a good idea to check with your pet's veterinarian to ensure that you're choosing a shampoo that will suit his or her needs.</p>

    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Keeping Your Dog's Eyes and Ears Safe While Bathing</strong></h4>

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Because shampoos and soaps might irritate your pet's eyes, ask your veterinarian for a sterile eye lubricant to use when washing. This will protect your pet's eyes from the shampoo. You may also regulate the flow of water while rinsing by using a sprayer or a showerhead with a long hose. Use a moist washcloth to gently remove any dirt or debris from your pet's face instead of washing his or her head. Place a huge cotton ball in each ear until the bath is finished to protect your pet's ears.</p>

    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Brushing Your Dog</strong></h4>

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        By eliminating debris, dispersing natural oils throughout her coat, minimizing tangles, and keeping her skin clean and irritant-free, regular brushing with a brush or comb will help maintain your pet's hair in good shape. Grooming time is also a good time to look for fleas and flea dirt—those small black specks that indicate your pet has a flea family. </p>

    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>The way you brush your pet and how often will largely depend on his or her coat type</strong></h4>

    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Smooth, Short Coats</strong></h4>

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        You just need to brush your dog once a week if he has a silky, short coat like a Chihuahua, Boxer, or Basset Hound. Remove dead hair with a bristle brush after loosening dead skin and debris using a rubber brush. With a chamois cloth, polish your low-maintenance pup and she'll be ready to shine! </p>
    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Long, Silky Coats</strong></h4>

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        If your dog has a long, rich coat like a Yorkshire terrier, she will require regular grooming. A slicker brush will be required to clear knots every day. Brush her coat with a bristle brush after that. Follow the methods above for a long-haired dog with a coat like a collie's or an Afghan hound's, but also comb through the fur and cut the hair around the feet.</p>
    <br>


    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Long Hair That's Frequently Matted</strong></h4>

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        It's a good idea to establish a regular grooming practice for long-haired dogs to eliminate tangles and avoid matting. Brush your pet with a bristle brush after gently teasing out knots with a slicker brush. If the matting is especially deep, trimming the hair may be an option, but be careful not to get close to the skin.</p>
    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Shedding</strong></h4>

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Although it is natural for dogs to lose old or damaged hair, the amount and frequency of hair shed is frequently dependent on their health, breed type, and season. In the winter, many dogs grow thick coats that are shed in the spring. Dogs who are always kept inside, on the other hand, have less changes in coat thickness and shed more uniformly throughout the year.</p>
    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Steps to Minimize Shedding</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        While you cannot prevent normal shedding in a healthy dog, you may lessen the quantity of hair in your house by brushing your dog on a regular basis. Request that your veterinarian or groomer prescribe a brush or comb that is specifically designed for your dog's hair type.</p>
    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Excessive Hair Loss</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Shedding is a natural part of a pet's life. Excessive shedding can also be avoided by eating properly. Quality pet food producers work hard to incorporate the correct quantity of nutrients so that supplements aren't necessary, but pets with allergies or sensitivities may need to try a variety of brands to find the one that works best for them.</p>
    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Excessive hair loss or bald patches, on the other hand, might be caused by one of the following:</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        -parasitic organisms (fleas, lice or mites)
        <br>-Infections caused by fungi or bacteria
        <br>-Allergies to inhalants or foods
        <br>-Diseases of the kidneys, liver, thyroid, or adrenal glands (including Cushing's syndrome)
        <br>-Lactation or pregnancy
        <br>-a number of drugs
        <br>-Self-inflicted harm as a result of licking
        <br>-Cancer
        <br>-Illness of the immune system
        <br>-Sunburn
        <br>-Contact with a caustic or unpleasant material
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Consult your veterinarian for treatment if you detect any of the following symptoms.</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        -Irritation of the skin, such as redness, pimples, rashes, or scabs
        <br>-Any type of open sore
        <br>-Spots of baldness or thinning of the coat
        <br>-Hair that is dull and dry and readily pulls out
        <br>-Scratching
        <br>-Constant licking of the feet or touching of the face
    </p>
    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Skin Problems</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Because your dog's skin is a reflection of her general health, it's critical to keep it in good form. When your dog has a skin condition, he or she may scratch, chew, and/or lick excessively. External parasites, infections, allergies, metabolic disorders, and stress, as well as a combination of these, might be to fault.</p>
    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Odor</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Check your pet's ears and teeth first, since they are frequently the source of germs that cause odor in pets. Keeping your dog clean by washing him on a regular basis may be all that is required to eliminate the odor.

<br><br>When used according to label guidelines, most dog perfumes are unlikely to be hazardous to your pet. Dogs with dermal allergies, on the other hand, may have skin discomfort, while those with nasal allergies may be impacted by the odor. If you want to use pooch perfume, follow the directions carefully and consult a veterinarian if your dog has a history of allergies.

<br><br>Whether grooming is ineffective and your dog continues to stink, see your veterinarian to determine if there is an underlying cause or infection.
    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Other Skin Problems</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        -Skin scratching, licking, or chewing
        <br>-Scabs
        <br>-Inflammation or redness
        <br>-There are certain hotspots (one particular area where itching is intense)
        <br>-Face and paws have round, scaly patches.
        <br>-Skin that is dry, flaking, or otherwise irritating
        <br>-bald patches, hair loss
        <br>-Rashes
        <br>-Lesions
        <br>-Blood or pus drainage
        <br>-Swellings, lumps, or discolouration of the skin
        <br>-Rubbing your face on the couch or the carpet

    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Causes of Skin Problems</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        One of the following conditions might be producing a skin anomaly in your dog and should be checked by a veterinarian.
        <br>-Fleas. Bites and droppings from these troublesome insects can irritate your dog's skin, and the saliva from a bite might cause an allergic reaction in certain canines. Some dogs are allergic to flea-treatment items; for example, certain flea collars might cause redness and inflammation around the neck.

        <br>-Ringworm. Inflammation, scaly areas, and hair loss are all symptoms of this extremely infectious fungal illness. To keep other dogs and humans in the house from being infected, you should treat it right away.

        <br>-Allergies to certain foods or seasons. Your dog's scratching might be caused by her sensitivity to allergens found in everyday items such as pollen, weeds, dust, mites, trees, mildew, and grasses. In the winter, many dogs, like people, develop dry, flaky skin. Many dogs are allergic to typical dog food components such beef, chicken, wheat, corn, or soy. Fillers and colorings might be mistaken for foreign objects by your dog's immune system, causing irritation and rashes.

        <br>-Infections of the skin When the skin is injured owing to the presence of another skin problem, dogs might develop uncomfortable bacterial or yeast infections.

        <br>-Sarcoptic mange is a kind of sarcoptic mange. This skin illness is caused by a Sarcoptes scabei mite infestation, which causes intense itching and skin inflammation, comparable to an allergic reaction.

        <br>-Products for grooming. Your dog's skin may be irritated by certain shampoos and grooming products. Make sure you only use grooming products designed for dogs.

        <br>-Boredom or stress. A dog may lick her skin excessively (particularly her legs) for a variety of reasons. When provided insufficient opportunities for physical or cerebral stimulation, some lick.

        <br>-Problems with metabolism or hormones. Changes in skin color, coat consistency, thickness, and distribution can be caused by a variety of hormonal issues.

    </p>
    <br>


    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Knowing When to See the Vet</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        If you observe any abnormalities in your pet's skin or hair, or if your pet begins to scratch, lick, or bite places on his fur excessively, you should book an appointment with your veterinarian right away.

<br>A skin biopsy, ringworm test, microscopic inspection of the hair and skin for parasites or infection, and blood tests to examine your dog's overall health are some of the diagnostic procedures your veterinarian may do to determine the origin of your dog's symptoms.

</p>
    <br>

    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>Mange</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Mange is a skin illness caused by a variety of little mites, which are frequent external parasites seen in canine companions. Some mange mites live in your dog's skin and hair follicles naturally, while others do not. While most dogs get along OK with their mites and never have any problems, if they proliferate, mites can cause moderate to severe skin illnesses.

<br>Sarcoptic mange and demodectic mange are the two kinds of mange. Sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabei) is caused by oval-shaped, light-colored, tiny mites that are also known as canine scabies. This form of management is simple to move between hosts.

<br>Demodectic mange (Demodex canis) mites are transmitted from mother to pup during the first few days of life in all dogs reared regularly by their mothers. Canines are affected by three forms of demodectic mange:

<br>-Mites proliferate in one or two tiny, limited regions in localized instances. This causes isolated scaly bald patches to emerge, generally on the dog's face, in a polka-dot pattern. This is a frequent disease in puppies and dogs under the age of 18 months. Approximately 90% of cases resolve without the need for any therapy.

<br>-In contrast, generalized instances impact a greater region of the dog's skin. This is an extremely painful, and frequently smelly, skin condition caused by secondary bacterial infections. This type of mange might indicate a weakened immune system, a genetic condition, an endocrine problem, or some underlying health problem. Treatment is determined on the age at when the dog was diagnosed with the ailment.

<br>-Demodectic pododermatitis is a kind of mange that is restricted to the foot and is associated with bacterial infections. To find these mites and provide a thorough diagnosis, deep biopsies are frequently necessary.
    </p>
    <br>


    <h4 align="center" style="margin-top:2%; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>General Symptoms of Mange in Dog</strong></h4>
    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        <span style="margin-left: 33%;">General Symptoms of Mange in Dog</span>

        <br>-Demodectic mange causes hair loss, bald areas, scabbing, and ulcers, and the condition can be unpleasant and painful due to bacterial infections.

        <br>-Restlessness and frenzied scratching are common signs of sarcoptic mange, which develop one week after exposure. Hair loss, reddish skin, body sores, and scabs are all possible side effects. The ears, elbows, face, and legs of a dog are the most typically afflicted places, although it can quickly spread throughout the body.
        
        <br>-Demodex mites can be passed from dog to dog, but as long as the dog is healthy, the mites just contribute to the dog's normal mite population, resulting in no skin condition. Even in the most severe situations, isolation of dogs is seen to be unnecessary. Dog-to-dog transmission is feasible under unusual conditions. Human or feline transmission of mites is quite unusual.
        
        <br>-When sarcoptic mange is discovered, the dog is usually quarantined to prevent the disease from spreading to other animals or people. When sarcoptic mange is transmitted to people, it generates a rash of red lumps that resembles mosquito bites.

        Take your dog to a veterinarian, who will do a physical examination, analyze skin scrapings, and use a microscope to confirm the presence of mange mites. Because identifying mange mites buried deep in a dog's skin might be challenging, your veterinarian may depend on clinical indicators or your pet's history to reach a definitive diagnosis.

<br>Medication may be administered orally or topically via injection, shampoo, or dip, depending on the kind of mange and the breed of dog. Secondary skin infections in certain sick dogs may necessitate particular care. Skin scrapings should be done every two weeks as part of the treatment.

<br>Please remember that many skin treatments can be hazardous to dogs, so consult your veterinarian before starting any mange treatment.

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Hot spots are inflamed, red, wet, hot, and irritated sores on a dog's head, hip, or chest that can be highly unpleasant for the dog. Allergies, bug, mite, or flea bites, poor grooming, underlying ear or skin illnesses, and frequent licking and biting induced by stress or boredom can all cause a hot patch to develop.

<br>Hot spots can occur in dogs that are not maintained frequently and have matted, unclean coats, as well as dogs who swim or are exposed to rain. Dogs with hip dysplasia or anal sac illness may also begin licking the skin on their hindquarters. Longhaired, thick-coated breeds are the most usually impacted.

<br>Because dogs lick, chew, and scratch the afflicted regions, hot spots frequently expand at an alarming pace in a short amount of time, aggravating the skin even more.

        If you observe any abnormalities in your pet's skin, or if your pet begins to scratch, lick, or bite regions of his fur excessively, you should take him to the doctor for an examination. Your veterinarian will try to figure out what's causing the hot areas. The underlying issue, whether it's a flea allergy, an anal gland infection, or stress, must be addressed. Your veterinarian will recommend the appropriate treatment and drugs to make your dog more comfortable and enable the hot patches to recover. An Elizabethan collar may be used to prevent your dog from biting and licking existing sores.

        <br>The following treatments may also be used:
        <br>-Hair around the lesion is shaved, allowing air and treatment to reach the area.

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Brushing your dog's teeth on a regular basis, coupled with a nutritious food and lots of chew toys, may help keep her mouth healthy. Bacteria and plaque-forming foods can cause tooth decay in dogs. This can cause gingivitis, receding gums, and tooth loss if it hardens into tartar. Because they aren't given sufficient oral care, many dogs exhibit indications of gum disease by the time they are four years old.

<br>If you give your dog regular house checkups, he'll be a very happy dog with a bright smile. Brushing your teeth two to three times a week is recommended.

<br>-To begin, acclimate your pet to the notion of having her teeth cleaned. Begin by gently massaging her lips in a circular motion with your finger for 30 to 60 seconds once or twice a day for a few weeks before going on to her teeth and gums.

<br>-Put a small amount of dog-formulated toothpaste on your pooch's lips after a few sessions or when she seems comfortable to get her used to the taste.

<br>-Introduce a toothbrush made just for cats or dogs, which will be smaller and have softer bristles than human toothbrushes. Toothbrushes that fit over your finger are also available, allowing you to give your pet's gums a good massage. the flavor

<br>-Clean in tiny, circular strokes with the brush or your gauze-wrapped finger at a 45-degree angle to the teeth. Working on one part of your dog's mouth at a time, elevating her lip as needed, is a good way to start. Tartar is more common on the side of the tooth that meets the face, and a last downward stroke can assist remove it.

<br>-Don't fight it if your dog refuses to get the inner surfaces of her teeth cleaned; just a minor amount of tartar builds up there. Brush your teeth two or three times a week once you've mastered the procedure.

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        It's fine if your dog's breath doesn't smell like a field of flowers. The fragrance of a dog's breath isn't especially pleasant. Bacteria developing from food particles lodged between the teeth or gum infection create halitosis, or foul breath, which can be the first indicator of an oral disease. Plaque and tartar are extremely common in certain canines, particularly tiny dogs. If plaque is the problem, your pet may need a professional cleaning, but frequent brushings at home are an excellent alternative.

<br>Consistent poor breath may signal digestive issues or a gum condition such as gingivitis, and your pet should be evaluated by a veterinarian. It's a good idea to take your dog to the vet if his breath is very unpleasant and is followed by a loss of appetite, vomiting, or excessive drinking or peeing.

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        Lift your pet's lips once a week to check his gums and teeth. The gums should be pink rather than white or red, and there should be no swelling. His teeth should be free of brownish tartar and clean. A veterinarian examination before to the procedure may be beneficial in determining whether your dog's gums are inflamed.

<br>Bad breath, drooling excessively, loose teeth, inflamed gums, tumors in the gums, or cysts beneath the tongue are all indicators that your dog may have a problem with his mouth or gastrointestinal system and should be evaluated by a veterinarian.

<br>Knowing what to look for in these common oral disorders can help you decide when it's time to take your pet to the vet:
<br>-Periodontal disease is an inflamed gum infection that can lead to tooth loss and infection throughout the body. Sneezing and nasal discharge are symptoms of loose teeth, foul breath, dental discomfort, and sneezing.

<br>-Gingivitis is a gum inflammation caused by plaque, tartar, and bacteria that cause disease above and below the gum line. Bleeding, swollen, red gums, and poor breath are all symptoms of gum disease. With frequent dental cleanings, it is reversible.

<br>-When tartar builds up and food gets lodged between the teeth, it causes swollen gums. Tartar and gingivitis may be avoided by brushing your dog's teeth at home and having annual cleanings at the vet.

<br>-When the gums grow over the teeth, it is known as proliferating gum disease, and it must be treated to avoid infection. Antibiotics can be used to treat this genetic ailment that affects boxers and bull terriers.

<br>-Tumors in the mouth show up as lumps in the gums. Some are cancerous and require surgical removal.

<br>-Salivary cysts resemble big, fluid-filled blisters behind the tongue, although they can also form around the jaw's corners. They require drainage, as well as the removal of the injured saliva gland.

        Give your dog treats that are particularly created to keep canine teeth healthy, and ask your doctor about a dry food that is carefully prepared to prevent plaque and tartar accumulation.

        <br>Chew toys are another excellent approach to fulfill your dog's natural want to chew while also strengthening his or her teeth. Gnawing on a chew toy may massage the gums and keep teeth clean by scraping away soft tartar, as well as alleviate tension and avoid boredom in your dog. Request toxin-free rawhide, nylon, and rubber chew toys from your veterinarian.

        <br>-A cherry-like tumor grows in the corner of the dog's eye due to an enlarged tear gland.
        <br>-Glaucoma: Due to increasing pressure in the eyeball, the cornea can become hazy and the eye can expand.
        <br>-Ectropion is defined as the outward twisting of the eyelid away from the eye (lower lids may look droopy).
        <br>-Entropion is a condition in which the upper eyelid rolls inward, causing discharge and tearing.
        <br>-Cataract: An opacity on the eye's lens can impair vision and even lead to blindness.

        Because some dogs dislike having their feet handled, it's always a good idea to get your dog acclimated to it before clipping his nails—ideally, this should begin while he's a puppy. Rub your hand up and down the leg, then softly touch each individual toe while lavishing praise and rewards on her! Your dog should feel more at ease with a nail trim after a week or two of daily foot massage.

        <br>Before commencing a puppy pedicure, exhaust your dog with some rigorous activity and request the support of an assistant to keep her still.

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        -Begin by thoroughly inspecting each of your dog's feet for dirt and debris.

        <br>-Take your dog's toe and softly but firmly grasp it. Insert a very small length of nail through the trimmer's opening to cut off the tip of each nail. Hold your trimmer so that you're cutting the nail from top to bottom at a slight angle, not side to side, and insert a very small length of nail through the trimmer's opening to cut off the tip of each nail. To keep the current curve of the nail, don't cut it at a blunt angle.
        
        <br>-With each pass, remove a small amount of nail until you see the beginnings of a circle (still nail-colored) develop on the sliced surface. The circle signals that you're getting close to the quick, a vein that runs through the nail, so you should stop working on that one and go on to the next.
        
        <br>-However, if your dog's nails are black, the quick will be harder to see, so be extra cautious. If you cut the quick by accident, it may bleed, in which case you can stop the bleeding using styptic powder or corn starch.
        
        <br>-Use an emery board to smooth any rough edges once the nails have been trimmed.

        If you hit the fast, your dog will almost certainly howl and resist. It's time to call it a day—but not before styptic powder or corn starch is applied to the bleeding nail tip. To ensure that the powder stays, use a little pressure as you press it into the wound. If bleeding persists for more than a few minutes, please contact your veterinarian so that clotting abnormalities may be checked on your dog.

    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
        When it comes to nail clipping, some dogs become afraid or aggressive. Panting, drooling, shaking, moaning, freezing, cowering, tail-tucking, growling, snarling, or snapping are all indicators of distress. Even with the most gentle and careful of introductions, some dogs appear to be unable to overcome their fear.

<br>Do not push your dog to submit if he falls within this group. If his veterinarian or a professional groomer can't get the job done, schedule an appointment with a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), a veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB), or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) to address the underlying issues.

        Your dog's paws, like people', require different forms of care depending on the season. The harsh winter weather can cause your dog's paws to chafe and break. Toxic chemicals can be swallowed by your dog when he licks his paws, and rock salt and chemical ice melters can cause sores, infection, and scorching. Wash your dog's paws with warm water after outside walks to remove salt and pollutants and beat the wintertime blues. Before each walk, you may want to apply Vaseline, a fantastic salt barrier, to your pet's pads—or make sure your dog is wearing canine booties.

        <br>It's vital to remember that your dog's paws are exposed to intense heat throughout the summer. Consider going barefoot onto a scorching sidewalk—ouch! Avoid walking your dog on hot pavement or sand to avoid blisters and burns. On your pet's pads, look for blisters, loose flaps of skin, and red, ulcerated regions. Apply antibacterial wash to the paw and wrap with a loose bandage for small burns. Please see your veterinarian right once if you have severe burns.

        Start slowly when beginning a new fitness regimen with your dog. When you first start taking your dog on walks or runs, his or her paws may get sensitive, chaffed, or damaged. When walking your dog, keep your house and yard free of sharp objects, and avoid risks such as broken glass and other trash. Keep in mind this simple rule: if you wouldn't go barefoot on it, neither would your dog.
